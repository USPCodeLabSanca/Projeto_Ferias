# 🍽️ Bandejão Quality – Telegram Menu Alert Bot

This project is a simple **web scraper** and **Telegram bot** that checks the daily menu from the [PUSP-SC cafeteria](https://www.puspsc.usp.br/cardapio/) and alerts the user via Telegram when certain keywords (like `"lasanha"` or `"frango"`) are found in the weekly menu.

## 🚀 Features

- Scrapes the current weekly menu (almoço & janta)
- Reads a custom list of keywords from a `.txt` file
- Sends Telegram alerts when a keyword is found
- Console output for each day’s menu

## 📂 Project Structure

```
.
├── scraper.py             # Main script (scraper + Telegram notifier)
├── meubot.py              # Simple test script for the bot
├── palavras_chaves.txt    # List of keywords (one per line)
└── .venv/                 # Virtual environment (should be gitignored)
```

## 📝 How it works

1. `scraper.py` fetches the weekly menu from the Bandejão site.
2. It parses each day and joins the lunch and dinner descriptions.
3. For each joined string, it checks whether **any of the keywords** (from `palavras_chaves.txt`) are present.
4. If a match is found, it:
   - Prints an alert to the console
   - Sends a message via Telegram with the day and matched keyword

## ✏️ Customize Your Keywords

Edit the `palavras_chaves.txt` file and add one keyword per line. For example:

```
frango
lasanha
pudim
batata
```

## 🔒 Security Note

The bot `TOKEN` and `CHAT_ID` in the code were **intentionally replaced** with placeholder values for public sharing.  
**Do not commit your real token or chat ID to GitHub.**
